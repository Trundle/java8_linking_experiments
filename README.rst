Type-safe URI routing in Java 8
===============================

Demonstration of type-safe URI routing. ``OtherResourceHandler`` links to
another resource whose behaviour is implemented by ``ScreenResourceHandler``
(i.e. hypermedia). The method that creates the links (``Router#linkTo``)
requires the same parameters as the actual handler method.
